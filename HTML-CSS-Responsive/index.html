                    <h2>Antonio Gaudi</h2>
                    <p>Antoni Gaudí i Cornet was a Spanish Catalan architect from Reus and the best known practitioner of Catalan Modernism. Gaudí's works reflect an individualized and distinctive style. </p>
                <p>Most are located in Barcelona, including his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família.</p>
